            <h2>Unicorn gundam wiki webpages</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              for this project this was the frist time coding my own wiki that
              would mostly show information and images of a gundamn name unicorn.
              for this wiki i started with something simple with coding in the images size
              and postion next adding the text about the unicorn and placing it under the image then 
              under text is the made up table and lastly would be adding a background.
              this project will act as a starter base for me learning the basic of html and class
              as a begginner.

            <h2>Trading card game guide App</h2>
            <p>
              For this project is mostly for my assisment which was to create a project that relate
              to computer science. So i picked creating a wiki app that about a trading card game called
              yugioh. the reason is mostly how i belelived there not enougth information about the game and 
              even if their was some people would not know where to start learnig so i create a app that informe
              the users about the trading card game and easy decks to learn. this was a 6 month project that involve
              researching, presenting my project using android studio, coding it, and presenting the beta version. overall 
              i had my struggles with it but with guidens and self learning and problem solving it was fun and i got a good grade 
              for it.
