            <h2>Unicorn gundam wiki webpages</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              For this project, it was the first time I coded my own wiki that
              would mostly display information and images of a Gundam named
              Unicorn. For this wiki, I started with something simple, coding
              the image size and position. Next, I added text about the Unicorn
              and placed it under the image. Below the text is the made-up
              table, and lastly, I would add a background. This project will
              serve as a starting base for me to learn the basics of HTML and
              CSS as a beginner.

            <h2>Trading card game guide App</h2>
            <p>
              "For this project, my primary objective was to fulfill my
              assignment, which required creating a project related to computer
              science. I chose to develop a wiki app centered around a trading
              card game called Yu-Gi-Oh!. My rationale for selecting this topic
              primarily stems from the perceived lack of comprehensive
              information about the game. Even if some resources existed, I
              believed that many individuals might struggle to find a starting
              point for learning. Therefore, I developed an app aimed at
              informing users about the trading card game and providing guidance
              on easy-to-learn decks. <br />
              <br />
              This project spanned six months and involved various stages,
              including research, presenting my project using Android Studio,
              coding using the language Kotlin, and presenting the beta version.
              While I encountered challenges along the way, through guidance,
              self-learning, and problem-solving, I found the experience
              enjoyable. Ultimately, I achieved a good grade for my efforts.
